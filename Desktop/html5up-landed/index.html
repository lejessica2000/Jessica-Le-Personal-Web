									<p>I'm a Computer Science major, and both a General
									Business and Technology Entrepreneurship minor at the
								  University of Maryland, College Park! I enjoy learning
								  about the business-related aspects of production,
								  as well as the technicalities of entering a market/
								  finding a niche for one's own business. Having the
									opportunity to delve into so many topics is extremely
									rewarding, and I am always excited to expand my
								  knowledege! As a member of the Global Communities living-learning program at UMD,
								  I am also always thinking about the effects of
								  an increasingly globalized world on technology and business.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>In my free time, I organize for Technica,
									work as an Ambassador for the Maryland Center for Women
									in Computing (MCWIC), and help raise money for St. Jude
									with my sorority, Tri Delta. I hope to work as a Software
									Engineer and relocate to somewhere new (New York, Boston,
									and Seattle are my dream cities) after
									graduation. Follow below for my professional experiences

							<h2>Technica</h2>
							<p>The world's largest all-women and non-binary hackathon!</p>

						<p>I currently work as an organizer on Technica's "Brand" team. I also

					  Though it was our first run at an Ambassador program, we were able to recruit students
					  from around the country to help us bring the hackathon to life!
					  I am so grateful to work with such an amazing organization, which
					  seeks to create a safe space for the underrepresented in Tech.
					  I first attended Technica as a hacker in 2018.</p>

							<h2>Maryland Center for Women in Computing</h2>

						<p>I've worked as an Ambassador for MCWIC since my

					  Connect students complete projects using Scratch, Lego Mindstorm
					  Robots, VR, and more. We also hold other workshops for kids and
					  UMD students themselves; our core focus is to encourage
					  students to pursue Computer Science, and to maintain/expand their initial
						interests in the field.
					  It is very important that we emphasize everyone's potential,
					  no matter their gender!</p>

							<h2>EqualLevel</h2>
							<p>Intern</p>
						</header>
						<p>I had the opportunity to work with EqualLevel during
						my Winter Break in January 2020. As the team had a new release, I helped
					  with regression testing; I worked closely with the Head QA Engineer
					  and used JIRA to keep track of potential bugs in the site. I am
					  grateful to be interning at EqualLevel again, in Summer 2020, where I will
						have more time to work on new projects that will further enrich my
						experience with e-procurement technologies. I am also looking forward to
						learning more about intricacies of the development process in general.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My favorite projects at UMD have been the Submit Server Stimulation
							and NFA/DFA project. The Submit Server project was in Java; I am especially fond of
				this project because it was the first in which I had to come up with
			 my own implementation (how I would store students' extra credit, etc.). This project
		 showed me the importance of choosing appropriate data structures and keeping my code
	 organized. The NFA/DFA project was in OCaml; though this was one of my more difficult projects,
 I enjoyed the challenge of translating conversions of NFAs, DFAs, and Regular Expressions into code.
I have so far had experience working in Java, Ruby, and OCaml.</p>

							<h2>My Vietnamese Roots</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Fun Fact: My real name is Van Ha Le, and in Vietnam, you state
						people's names in the opposite order (Last, Middle, First). Because I was born in
					  2000 - the year of the dragon - my parents chose "Ha" to depict
					  a dragon's ability to swim (means a body of water), and "Van" as
					  a representation of the dragon's ability to fly (translates to "sky").
					  In high school, as I started to embrace my background, I chose to
					  complete my Senior Capstone project on the Vietnam War (from the
						Vietnamese perspective). I didn't believe this point of view was
					  adequately shown in school or in any texts in general; I interviewed
					  parents from my old Vietnamese School and collected their
					  stories to form a magazine!</p>

							<h2>UMD Alternative Breaks</h2>
							<p>Refugee and Immigrant Rights (Nashville, TN)</p>
						</header>
						<p>In Spring 2018, I went on one of UMD's
						Alternative Breaks.
						On each day of our trip, we visited 1-2 organizations working to support the
						immigrant and refugee population in Nashville (to provide housing,
						financial assistance, etc.); it was apparent that many of us
						felt a deep connection to this topic, as the majority of our group came from immigrant parents.
						It was painful to see how
						Nashville residents, who live in a very diverse melting pot, have experienced a lot of backlash
						from their own government.

							<h2>Music Festivals</h2>
							<p>Favorite: Moonrise Festival in Baltimore!</p>
						</header>
						<p>Music is something that helps me escape from reality; being able
					  to find songs that match my mood is something that I love! I was
						fortunate to attend Sweetlife Festival in 2016, Shamrock festival in
						2017 & 2018, and Moonrise Festival in
					  2018 & 2019. I was hoping to attend Firefly 2020, though plans
					  came to a halt due to Covid-19. Something about being outside all day,
					  listening to your favorite artists, and having a big area to
					  roam (dance) in is magical. It is great seeing artists come together for
					digital festivals now, as safety is 100% most important!</p>

							<h2>Keeping Up with the Entertainment Industry</h2>
							<p>my guilty pleasure...</p>
						</header>
						<p>I like to pay attention to trends in fashion, and follow
						celebrity news. This is mainly because it is purely fun and
					  interesting, and seeing famous looks can always serve as
					  good inspiration! I also am intrigued by social media,
					  and the way young people are affected by it; I would love
					  to learn more about big social platforms and the ideas behind
					  their technical developments, as well as do more research on
					  the toxicity that
					  gains prominence in an increasingly technologized world.
					There are always positives and negatives to a more connected world.</p>
